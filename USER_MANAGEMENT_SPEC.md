## Page Behavior

### Initial Load
- Display the header with the title and logout button.

- If there are more users than fit on one page, show pagination controls.

### Adding a User
1. Administrator clicks the "Add User" button.
2. A modal or form appears with input fields for Name, Email, Password, and Role.
3. Administrator fills out the form and clicks "Save".
4. The system validates the input:
   - All required fields are filled.
   - Email format is correct and unique.
5. If validation passes:
   - The new user is added to the user list.
   - A success notification is displayed.
6. If validation fails:
   - Display appropriate error messages.

### Editing a User
1. Administrator clicks the "Edit" button corresponding to a user.
2. A modal or form appears pre-filled with the user's current information.
3. Administrator updates the desired fields and clicks "Save".
4. The system validates the input.

3. Upon confirmation:
   - The user is removed from the user list.
   - A success notification is displayed.

### Searching for Users
- As the administrator types into the search bar, the user list filters in real-time to match the search query based on name or email.

### Pagination
- Administrators can navigate between pages using the pagination controls.
- The current search/filter state is maintained across different pages.

## Initial Display to User
Upon accessing the User Management Screen, administrators should see:
- The header with "User Management" title and a logout option.
- A search bar to filter users.
- An "Add User" button to create new users.
- A table listing existing users with their ID, Name, Email, Role, and action buttons (Edit/Delete).
- Pagination controls if the number of users exceeds the page limit.
- If no users exist, display a message such as "No users found. Click 'Add User' to create a new account."

## Additional Considerations
- **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords, are handled securely (e.g., hashing passwords before storage).
- **Performance**: Optimize loading times, especially when dealing with a large number of users.
- **User Experience**: Provide clear feedback on actions (e.g., loading indicators, confirmation dialogs).
